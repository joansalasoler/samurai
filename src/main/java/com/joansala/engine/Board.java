/**
 * Immutable state of a match on a given instant.
 *
 * A {@code Board} object encapsulates the state of a {@code Game}, which
 * includes the player to move, the location of the game pieces and any
 * other information relevant for the gameplay; and provides methods for
 * the conversion of the game state between different representations.
 *
 * For example, a chess {@code Board} may encapsulate the possibility of
 * an en-passant capture or the number of moves performed along with the
 * position of the pieces and the turn; and use the Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation
 * to encode the game state as a diagram string ({@see toDiagram}) and an
 * Algebraic Notation to encode sequence of moves ({@see toNotation(int[])}).
 *
 * It is a requirement for the board to be immutable. Any methods that
 * return state data must either return immutable objects or a new copy.
