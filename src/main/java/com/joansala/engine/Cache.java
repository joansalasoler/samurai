/**
 * Stores information about a game state.
 *
 * <p>A cache object may be used by an engine as a temporary memory space
 * to store and retrieve information about searched game states. This is
 * usually known as transposition tables.</p>
 *
 * <p>The method {@code store} is used to ask the cache to remember the
 * relevant information for a position. Then this information may be
 * retrieved calling the method {@code find}. After this is called the
 * object getters may be used to retrieve the game state information.</p>
 *
 * <p>Therefore, performing a look up for a game position consists on
 * first searching the position and then retrieving its values:</p>
 * <pre>
 *   if (cache.find(game)) {
 *      int score = cache.getScore();
 *      int move = cache.getMove();
 *   }
 * </pre>
